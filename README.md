## Table Tennis Launcher
## Introduction
This project aims to develop a table tennis ball launcher system for NYP Table Tennis CCA to help trainees practice effectively without needing a practice buddy. Below is the comprehensive development process of the system.

### Project Development Steps

1. **Empathy Mapping**
   - Understand the needs, frustrations, and desires of table tennis players through interviews and observations.
   - Identify their pain points and the gains they seek from an improved training experience.

2. **Objective Tree**
   - Identify and prioritize design objectives such as improving solo practice, enhancing unpredictability, and providing real-time feedback.

3. **Concept Development**
   - Generate multiple design concepts for the table tennis ball launcher, considering various mechanisms and functionalities.

4. **Concept Selection**
   - Use a decision matrix to evaluate and select the most feasible and effective design.

5. **Prototype Building**
   - Construct a low-resolution prototype using available materials, focusing on key functionalities like ball launching, trajectory control, and durability.

6. **Prototype Testing**
   - Test the prototype with users to gather feedback on design, durability, and safety features.

7. **Iteration and Improvement**
   - Make necessary adjustments based on user feedback and technical challenges faced during testing.

8. **Final Presentation**
   - Prepare and deliver a presentation showcasing the empathy map, objective tree, concept development, selected design, prototype, and user feedback.
